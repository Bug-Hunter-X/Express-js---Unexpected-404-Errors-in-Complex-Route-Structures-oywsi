# Express.js - Unexpected 404 Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in Express.js where 404 errors occur even when routes appear correctly defined. This typically happens in complex applications with nested routes, middleware, or dynamic URL segments where path matching might fail unexpectedly. 

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.

## Problem:
Incorrect path handling can cause unexpected 404 errors.  The issue often stems from improper middleware placement or subtle issues with how Express matches routes.  Debugging this often requires careful examination of the route order and path parameters. 

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully reviewing the route definitions and middleware placement to ensure Express correctly handles the requests. This might involve restructuring routes, adding more specific routes, or adjusting middleware usage.
